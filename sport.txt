At UPES, we put maximum focus on physical fitness and promote various sports activities. We encourage students to participate and excel in a variety of games and sports that are organized regularly in the university.
The cultural committee provides numerous opportunities for students to get involved, have fun, showcase their talents, and compete against other colleges in a variety of competitions. UPES under the aegis of Office of Student Engagement & Experience every year organizes fresher’s party and the Annual Cultural Festival – Uurja, which gives a platform to students to showcase their talents.

 UPES pays emphasis on the both physical and mental health of its students. Located in the lap of nature, the beautiful serene campus offers conducive atmosphere to the students to relax. We provide ample opportunities to the students to explore new healthy ways of living which they may not have been exposed at home. We believe that yoga and meditation are the perfect activities to foster physical and emotional calmness and wellbeing.
